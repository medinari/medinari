# 👋 Welcome to Ricardo A.O. Medina's GitHub Profile

## 🧬 About Me
I am a **veterinarian, immunologist, and bioinformatics enthusiast** with a multidisciplinary background in biology, molecular biotechnology, and microbial research. With over eight years of experience in academia and research institutions, I specialize in **immunology**, **vaccine development**, and **bioinformatics**, leveraging both experimental and computational methods.

My passion lies in addressing complex biological problems through **cutting-edge technologies** and collaborative research, particularly in immunology and the development of vaccines for zoonotic diseases.

## 🔬 Areas of Expertise
- **Vaccine Development:** 
   - Development and testing of chimeric proteins and peptides as vaccine candidates.
   - Preclinical trials using **animal models** (mice and sheep).
   - Experience with adjuvants, antigen design, and monoclonal antibody production.

- **Molecular and Cellular Biology:**
   - Expertise in **protein engineering**, including recombinant protein design and purification.
   - Practical knowledge in immunological techniques such as **ELISA**, **Western Blotting**, and T-cell response assays.

- **Genomics and Proteomics:**
   - Identification of vaccine candidates using **proteomic approaches**.
   - Proficiency in **DNA extraction**, **PCR-based gene identification**, and **MS/MS data analysis**.

- **Bioinformatics:**
   - Computational modeling for protein bioactivity and vaccine targets.
   - Experience with **NGS workflows**, **data analysis in Python and R**, and molecular visualization tools like **PyMOL**.

## 🌟 What I’m Looking For
I am open to collaborating on:
- Academic and industry projects focused on **vaccine development**, **immunology**, and **bioinformatics**.
- Computational approaches for understanding pathogen-host interactions or identifying therapeutic targets.
- Mentorship and teamwork opportunities to advance novel research.
