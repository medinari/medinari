  - Development of **diagnostic methods**.  
  - Creation of **protein- and peptide-based vaccines**.  
  - Study of **vaccine adjuvants**.  
  - Conducting **efficacy trials in animal models**, including **sheep** and **inbred mice**.  

**Current Research:**  

Based in **Austria**, Ricardo contributes to projects aimed at understanding the **mechanisms of T-cell exhaustion**, a critical aspect of:  
  - **Chronic viral infections**.  
  - **Cancer immunology** and advancing **immunotherapy**.  

**Informatics Enthusiast:**  

Passionate about the transformative impact of **high-throughput sequencing** and **bioinformatics** in microbiology.  
  - Particularly interested in **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **machine learning** to:  
    - Process large datasets.  
    - Improve diagnostic precision.  
    - Predict disease outbreaks.  
    - Identify vaccine antigens.  

**Ongoing Education:**  

Currently pursuing a **master's degree in bioinformatics** to:  
  - Use computational tools for modeling infection dynamics and immune responses.  
  - Develop more effective **treatments** and **vaccines**.  
  - Promote **alternatives to animal testing** and advance **in vitro models**.
